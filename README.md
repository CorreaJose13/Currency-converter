# Currency Converter API 

This project is a simple currency converter API built using Java. It allows users to convert currencies based on the latest exchange rates generated by https://www.exchangerate-api.com/.

## Package Structure

The Currency Converter API is organized into the following packages:

### `com.aluracursos.currencyconverter.api`

This package contains the API-related classes that provide the core functionality for the currency converter. The main classes in this package are:

* `CurrencyService`: This class is responsible for retrieving the latest exchange rates for a given currency. It acts as a bridge between the API and the external data source that provides the exchange rates.
* `ConversionController`: This class takes care of converting a given amount from one currency to another based on the latest exchange rates. It uses the data provided by the `CurrencyService` to perform the conversion.

### `com.aluracursos.currencyconverter.currency`

This package contains the main entry point for the application, which is the `CurrencyConverterAPI` class. This class is responsible for initializing the `CurrencyService` and `ConversionController` instances and starting the currency conversion process. All currency conversions are based on the dollar exchange rate, simplifying the consumption of the app's exchange rate API.

### `com.aluracursos.currencyconverter.processor`

This package contains the `Processor` class, which is responsible for processing the currency conversion using the `ConversionController`. The `Processor` class acts as a coordinator, ensuring that the conversion is performed correctly and handling any errors that might occur during the process.

### `com.aluracursos.currencyconverter.models`

This package contains the data models used by the Currency Converter API. The main classes in this package are:

* `CurrencyDTO`: The CurrencyDTO class in the Currency Converter API transfers currency data between the CurrencyService and an external exchange rates source. It has a single property, conversion_rates, a map with currency codes as keys and exchange rates as values.
* `Conversion`: This class represents a currency conversion, with properties such as the source currency, the target currency, and the converted amount. The `Conversion` class is used to store the results of a currency conversion performed by the `ConversionController` class.

### `com.aluracursos.currencyconverter.util`

This package contains utility classes that provide common functionality used throughout the Currency Converter API. The main classes in this package are:

* `EnvLoader`: This class is responsible for loading environment variables used by the Currency Converter API. It provides a method to retrieve the value of an environment variable, and throws an exception if the variable is not set. This class is used to load the API key for the external data source that provides the latest exchange rates.
* `DateFormat`: This class is a utility class designed to format the current date and time into a specific string format. 
* `Strings`: This class is a utility class that provides formatted string constants for use in the Processor class. It contains the menu and options of the textual interface.

By organizing the code into these separate packages, the Currency Converter API achieves a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend the application in the future.

## Demo

This application accepts all currency codes supported by the ExchangeRate API and offers the user a list of some of the currencies they can use, along with the operational options implemented in the application:

### Lowercase Currency Codes

The application even allows the currency code to be entered in lowercase:
